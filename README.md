#### Binomial Distribution
The binomial distribution is a common discrete distribution used in statistics, as opposed to a continuous distribution, such as the normal distribution. 
Binomial distribution summarizes the number of trials, or observations when each trial has the same probability of attaining one particular value.

#### Normal Distribution |
Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near 
the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.

#### The Central Limit Theorem |
The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the 
population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed
